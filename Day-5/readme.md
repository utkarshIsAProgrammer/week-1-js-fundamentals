Todayâ€™s mission wasnâ€™t just about fixing broken codeâ€”it was about fixing myself.
I realized I relied way too much on AI while learning and building. I cheated myself out of the pain, and pain is how we remember. So I decided to repeat Day 4 of my JavaScript reset challenge under no-crutch conditions. No AI. No MDN. No Google. No Stack Overflow. Just me, my brain, and console.log().

ðŸš« Zero shortcuts.
ðŸ’¡ Full struggle.
ðŸ’¥ Brutal honesty.
